# Hi, I'm Nitin Nayar 👋

## About Me

20 years building and scaling technology companies. Started as a developer, evolved through product management, and spent the last decade in Solutions Engineering—often as the first SE hired in Europe, partnering directly with founders to grow the European businesses into multi-million dollar operations.

Now focused on the most disruptive technology shift of our generation: AI. Building practical applications with LLMs and autonomous agents, bringing the same customer-first, ship-fast mindset that's worked in previous ventures.

## 🔭 What I'm Currently Building

**Production AI Tools for Solutions Engineering:**

🎯 **POV Progress Tracker**  
Python application that uses AI to analyze proof-of-value engagements in real-time. Automatically summarizes technical details, tracks open actions and milestones, calculates win probability, and provides tactical guidance for securing technical wins. Includes objection handling frameworks and competitive positioning insights.

⚡ **AI-Enhanced SE Workflows**  
Integrating AI into daily operations to scale expertise and increase velocity:
- **Structured Learning System** - Notion + AI for rapid product/tool mastery
- **Automated Task Management** - Claude with Linear MCP for intelligent project tracking
- **Meeting Intelligence** - Zoom recordings + Claude for automatic action item extraction and follow-up generation

📚 **Prompt Engineering for SEs**  
GitHub repository of battle-tested prompts for Solutions Engineering contexts. Covering discovery analysis, technical documentation, demo scripting, objection handling, and competitive positioning. Moving from personal toolkit → open-source resource → blog series.

_These aren't learning projects—they're production tools I use daily to deliver better customer outcomes._

## 💼 What I Bring

**The trifecta that AI companies need:**
- **Technical depth:** Started as a developer, understand architecture and implementation
- **Business acumen:** Grown early-stage companies from first customer to 8-figure revenue  
- **Customer expertise:** First Solutions Engineer in Europe for multiple startups—I know how to make complex technology accessible and valuable

**My sweet spot:** Taking cutting-edge technology and translating it into solutions that customers actually buy and use.

### 💡 My Philosophy

_"The best technology is invisible—it just works. My job is making AI feel inevitable, not intimidating."_

**Status:** 🚀 Building in public. Week 1 of expanding my technical toolkit with hands-on AI development.
