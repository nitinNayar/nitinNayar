# Hi, I'm Nitin Nayar 👋

## About Me

20+ years building and scaling technology companies. Started as a developer (Cisco in the early 2000s), evolved through product management, and spent the last decade as a hands-on, technical IC in Solutions Engineering.

Often the first SE hired in Europe, I build new markets from scratch— currently scaling Semgrep's initial EMEA footprint and previously expanding ThousandEyes' business with Europe's top-6 FSI leaders. I act as a trusted advisor to strategic tech and financial services customers, ensuring their success from first deployment to full-scale operation.

Now focused on the most disruptive technology shift of our generation: AI. Building practical applications with LLMs and autonomous agents, bringing the same customer-first, ship-fast mindset that's worked in previous ventures.

## What I'm Currently Building

**Production AI Tools for Solutions Engineering:**

**POV Progress Tracker**  
Python application that uses AI to analyze proof-of-value engagements in real-time. Automatically summarizes technical details, tracks open actions and milestones, calculates win probability, and provides tactical guidance for securing technical wins. Includes objection handling frameworks and competitive positioning insights.

**AI-Enhanced SE Workflows**  
Integrating AI into daily operations to scale expertise and increase velocity:
- Structured Learning System - Notion + AI for rapid product/tool mastery
- Automated Task Management - Claude with Linear MCP for intelligent project tracking
- Meeting Intelligence - Zoom recordings + Claude for automatic action item extraction

**Prompt Engineering for SEs**  
GitHub repository of battle-tested prompts for Solutions Engineering contexts. Covering discovery analysis, technical documentation, demo scripting, objection handling, and competitive positioning. Moving from personal toolkit → open-source resource → blog series.

_These aren't learning projects—they're production tools I use daily to deliver better customer outcomes._

## What I Bring

**The trifecta that AI companies need:**
- **Technical depth:** Started as a developer, understand architecture and implementation
- **Business acumen:** Grown early-stage companies from first customer to 8-figure revenue  
- **Customer expertise:** First Solutions Engineer in Europe for multiple startups—I know how to make complex technology accessible and valuable

**My sweet spot:** Taking cutting-edge technology and translating it into solutions that customers actually buy and use.
